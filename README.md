---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

The **CPQ AI Agent** is an enterprise-grade conversational AI system that automates the complete Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) sales process. Built on a query-centric RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, it delivers intelligent, context-aware responses while eliminating manual overhead on Product Management teams.

### **Problem Solved**
- **Manual CPQ Process**: Time-intensive quote generation requiring extensive PM involvement
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited Product Management bandwidth for customer quotes
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Variable quote accuracy and completeness across sales teams
- **Slow Response Times**: Extended customer wait times impacting sales velocity
- **Scalability Issues**: Process bottlenecks that don't scale with business growth

### **Solution Delivered**
A conversational RAG-driven AI Agent managing the complete CPQ workflow with:
- ‚úÖ **Automated Configuration**: AI-guided product selection and validation
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Pricing**: Dynamic pricing with market factors and volume projections
- ‚úÖ **Query-Centric RAG**: Knowledge-driven responses with 35 verified operations
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise Integration**: Full n8n v1.109 workflow automation
- ‚úÖ **Zero PM Overhead**: Self-service quote generation without additional organizational burden
